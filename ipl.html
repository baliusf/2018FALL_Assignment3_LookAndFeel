				<td class="description">Second retained player by CSK ahead of the IPL Auction 2018, Suresh Raina is a visual treat for the spectators in this shortest format of the game. A solid striker of the ball, he possesses the rare quality of performing well under pressure. Batting in the top order, Raina has mastered the art of finishing games. The left-handed batsman is also a part-time off-break bowler who often provides that crucial breakthrough at the right time. To add to his talent with the bat and the ball, Raina is a livewire on the field with good reflexes</td>

He was part of the victorious Indian U-19 cricket team that won the World Cup in Malaysia in 2008. His performance in IPL 2008 helped Rajasthan Royals to title victory and earned him the nickname "Rockstar" by his captain Shane Warne. In 2012 IPL player auction, Jadeja was bought by Chennai Super Kings for approx. Rs. 9.8 Crore, making him the most expensive player of the year's auction</td>
