The flamboyant Baroda all-rounder never lets pressure affect his game, but instead relishes such situations. A big hitter and a fast-bowling all-rounder, Hardik ticks all the boxes that a team desires from an all-rounder. It was no surprise that he was fast tracked into the Indian ODI and T20 side after a successful run in the IPL 2015. A favourite of coach Ricky Ponting, Hardik has worked both on batting and bowling, to secure the spot of the all-rounder.

For long, India had struggled to find a bowler who could be effective in the death overs. Dhoni’s long search finally ended when Bumrah answered his calls with his ability to bowl yorkers. While the yorker is his most potent weapon, Bumrah’s unorthodox action makes it very difficult for batsmen to read him. If the IPL is all about spotting Indian talent and giving them the platform, the credit for Bumrah’s rapid rise must go to Mumbai Indians</td>
